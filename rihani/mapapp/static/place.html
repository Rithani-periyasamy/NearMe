        <h1>A.Thirumuruganpoondi</h1>
        <p>Thirumuruganpoondi is a municipality in Tamil Nadu's Tiruppur district, notable for the ancient Thirumuruganatheswarar Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. Located about 7 km south of Tiruppur city, the temple is a significant pilgrimage site and a Paadal Petra Sthalam, featuring unique Dravidian architecture without a rajagopuram. The area's name is linked to a legend where Lord Murugan worshipped Shiva here to absolve a brahmmahathi dosham (sin) after defeating the demon Soorapadman. </p>
